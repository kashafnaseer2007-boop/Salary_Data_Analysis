# Salary Regression Analysis

A Jupyter notebook that predicts salary based on years of experience using regression.

## Files

- `My Regression.ipynb` – main analysis notebook  
- `Salary_Data.csv` – synthetic dataset (YearsExperience vs Salary)

   ```
3. Launch Jupyter:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open `My Regression.ipynb` and run all cells

## What the notebook does

- Loads `Salary_Data.csv`  
- Visualizes the relationship (scatter plot + regression line)  
- Splits data into train/test  
- Trains a linear regression model  
- Evaluates using metrics (e.g., R², MSE)  
- Makes predictions on new experience values

## Notes
